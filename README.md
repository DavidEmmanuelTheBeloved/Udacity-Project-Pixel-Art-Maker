# Project: Pixel Art Maker

Oh hello there, this repository is for the Pixel Art Maker Project, which is part of my [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

## The Project Details

In this project, we have been provided with a headstart via the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter).  Using this template, I'm building the script to do the following:

1. Upon form submission, build the grid.
    - The form provides the number of rows (via the grid height) and columns (via the grid width).
    - The grid is a `<table>`.
2. Upon clicking on a single grid square, color that square's background color to the currently selected hex color.
3. Build it with JavaScript (not jQuery).
