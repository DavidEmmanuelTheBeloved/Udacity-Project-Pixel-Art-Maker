# Project: Pixel Art Maker

Oh hello there, this repository is for the Pixel Art Maker Project, which is part of my Google Africa Challenge Scholarship: Front-End program.

## The Project Details

In this project, we have been provided with a headstart via the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/project-pixel-art-maker-starter) so we don't have to build from scratch. Using this template, I am building the app to enable users do the following:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

In this project, i'll use my front-end programming skills from JavaScript Foundations and Intro to jQuery, including:

1. Defining variables with const and let
2. Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
3. Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
4. Writing nested loops and using loop variables

I will be employing jQuery as a tool to manipulate the DOM for this project.
